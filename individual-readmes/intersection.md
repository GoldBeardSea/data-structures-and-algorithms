# Challenge Summary

Given two Binary Trees, return a set of integers that are common between the two trees.

## Challenge Description

Given two binary trees return a set of shared values. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Right now my approach is O(n+m) Space, I say that because I iterate across both inputted trees then iterate across a newly created set to fill the result set. 

O(n) space.

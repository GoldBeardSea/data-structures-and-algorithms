# Challenge Summary
Find the most repeated word. 
## Challenge Description
Write a method that finds the most repeated word.  

## Approach & Efficiency
Right now my approach is to split the string and add all the words to a HashMap then grabbing the entries and matching the highest count to the key. 

Big O for both should be O(n)

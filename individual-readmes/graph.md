# Graph
A graph is a data structure made up of nodes/verticies and edges, connections to those node, those connections can have weight. 

## Challenge
One graph has to have the ability to connect one and many other kinds of nodes in a relational way. 

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach for now is working with a Graph that has subclassed within it, a node with weight. 

## API
size() returns size

addNode(String string) adds a node to the list with no additional weight.

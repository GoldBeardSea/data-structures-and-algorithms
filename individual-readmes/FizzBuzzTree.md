# Challenge Summary
Given a Binary Tree of integers replace the integers with Fizz, Buzz or Fizzbuzz respectively following standard FizzBuzz challenges. 
## Challenge Description
Write a fizzbuzz method that can be applied to a binary tree. 
## Approach & Efficiency
My approach for this particular method is to do a traversal and replace the integers with their respective strings. I decided to do this as a void as that is what makes the most sense to me. My approach to testing was checking certain nodes before and after application of the method onto a tree. If I wanted to change my approach I would think about doing a static method that I could apply to any binary tree that can handle object nodes to switch them out. 

My solution takes O(n) time and O(1) Space.

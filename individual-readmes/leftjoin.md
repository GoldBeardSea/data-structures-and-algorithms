# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Conduct a Left join on a synonym and antonym word table. 

## Challenge
Create a new data structure that joins on the left (synonym table, so that if there is no antonym that place will return null). 

## Approach & Efficiency
My Approach was to use the Object wrapper to deal with Data types within the execution of the join. When dealing with keysets and other forms of data, since the relationship output was agnostic and the association was most important, I created a data structure that had an Key object to an Object pair. 

## Solution
Will do one tomorrow and edit it.

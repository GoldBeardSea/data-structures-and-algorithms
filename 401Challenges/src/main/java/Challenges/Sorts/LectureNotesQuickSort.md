Lecture Notes: Merge Sort

Quick Sort takes pivot points and sorts based on those pivot points recursively. The particular implementation sorts the array based on the position of the high, as the mark for the pivot.

Complexity
Big 0 can either be n logn for a best case scenario and a n^2 for a worst case scenario.
